		<h3>Definition by IUCN</h3>
		<p>International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) defines Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) as a long-term process to regain ecological functionality and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded landscapes, in biomes with the natural potential to support trees. It requires integrating with other land uses, delivery of a broader range of societal benefits and a vision for a better managed landscape.</p>

		<br>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>FLR was launched by Sarawak Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg on 15 June 2019 at Sabal Agroforestry Centre. The principles behind the restoration of forest is nothing new in Sarawak as it existed as early as 1920s, through the gazettement of Totally Protected Areas (TPAs) and Permanent Forest Estates (PFEs).</p>

		<br>

		<h3>Initiatives</h3>
		<p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled">
				<li>1. Establishment of FLR Task Force</li>
				<li>2. To revive and establish nurseries</li>
				<li>3. Leverage technology and data management</li>
				<li>4. Enhancing Communication, Education and Public Awareness (CEPA)</li>
				<li>5. Intensify research and development</li>
				<li>6. Collaboration with stakeholders and engagement with local communities</li>
			</ul>

Both species were planted at the same time.</figcaption>

				<p class="mb-4">In 1920s, efforts were made to test both indigenous and exotic species in Sarawak. The forest plantation started the Engkabang groups. They were the important producers of the illipenut.</p>

				<p class="mb-4">The beginning of planting experiments with various exotic and indigenous species as well as nursery experiments and small scale tapping experiments.</p>

				<p class="mb-4">The introduction of scheme for timber plantations (mainly Ranggu and Durian) with hill rice in Sungai Semenggoh Forest Reserve.</p>

				<h4>1965</h4>
				<p class="mb-4">Reforestation Research Programme was drawn up and implemented in the First Malaysia Plan.</p>

				<h4>1970 - 1979</h4>
				<p>Forestry Department began experimenting with some of the fast-growing exotic tropical hardwoods. Species with longer rotation period were also added to the list.</p>

				<h4>1980 - 1990</h4>
				<p class="mb-4">Reforestation of ex-shifting cultivation sites along the foot hills of Gunung Gading, Semenggoh and Sampadi.</p>

				<h4>1991 - 1995</h4>
				<p class="mb-4">The agroforestry project at Sabal FR had brought significant benefits to the communities through participation in various projects such as the Cocoa/Durian project, cattle project and fishpond project. These projects aimed to raise the income level and improve the living standards of the communities.</p>

				<h4>1996</h4>
				<img class="w-100 mb-4" src="{% static 'img/1996.png' %}">
				<p class="mb-4">The Chief Minister stated that the state had reached its peak in producing timber and needed to find better ways to sustain timber resources. State's timber industry will be better off with reforestation of fast growing species as a mean to supplement timber production.</p>

				<h4>1998</h4>
				<img class="w-100 mb-4" src="{% static 'img/1998.png' %}">
				<p class="mb-4">International Conference was held in Kuching to get the experience from the people that had developed planted forest elsewhere and gave insights on how it can be done in Sarawak.</p>

				<h4>2000 - 2010</h4>
				<p class="mb-4">Agroforestry Projects were implemented based on localities; Sabal Agrofrestry Centre, Balai Ringin PF, Niah FR, FOMISS-SAMLING Pilot Area, Ulu Baram and Kampung Silok, Lundu.</p>

				<h4>2011 - 2018</h4>
				<p class="mb-4">The establishment of planted forest was a long-term strategy towards providing an alternative source of raw material for wood-based industries in Sarawak.</p>
